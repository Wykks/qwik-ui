## Why use a headless select?

The native `<select>` HTML element encounters significant obstacles in terms of styling flexibility, consistency across different browsers, and delivering a seamless user experience.

### Native select pain points

- **Styling Limitations**: Customizing the appearance of a native select element is notoriously difficult, leading to inconsistent designs across different platforms.
- **Multiselect Complexity**: The native multiselect feature is not intuitive, especially for non-technical users, as it requires the use of control or command keys to select multiple options.
- **Limited Typeahead Support**: Native select elements offer minimal support for finding options by typing, making it harder for users to quickly find options.
- **Inconsistent Behavior**: There's a lack of consistency in behavior and styling of the select element across different browsers and devices.

### Native effort

The [Open UI group](https://open-ui.org/components/selectlist/) has been working towards filling in some of these gaps with a new HTML element called `selectlist`.

It is still not supported by any major browsers, and there is still an ongoing debate about its future, including a possible attribute to the select element to fix some of the problems instead.

### Philosophy

Qwik UI's Select component is designed to solve these pain points out of the box, along with a focus on accessibility and usability.

It intends to feel like a native select element, providing intuitive APIs and behavior.

## Passing data

The select component accepts data similar to the native select element. Option data can be passed in directly to `<SelectOption />`.

### Basic example

<Showcase name="string" />

By default, the content inside of the `<SelectOption />` component is the option value.

### Mapping over data

<Showcase name="hero" />

You are in full control of how the data is rendered. Map over the data, or render the options however you like.

> Maybe the options are out of order and you want to sort them? Programmatically update them directly in the JSX? You can do that!

### Object example

<Showcase name="object" />

> In a case like the above example, where the display value can get cluttered, you may want to provide a `value` prop to the `<SelectOption />` component. We will refer to this in the next section.

### Passing a distinct value

<div data-testid="select-option-value-test">
  <Showcase name="option-value" />
</div>

Sometimes we want to display one thing to the user, but pass another value to the option.

By adding the `value` prop to the `<SelectOption />` component, we can pass a distinct value to the select component.

> A common use case is to select a user's unique account id, rather than their name.

### Handling selection changes

<div data-testid="select-change-test">
  <Showcase name="change-value" />
</div>

We can listen to changes in the selected value by using the `onChange$` prop. It provides an argument that is the new selected value.

The above example increments a count when the user selects a new option.

## Component state

We can select an initial uncontrolled value by passing the `value` prop to the `<Select />` root component.

### Uncontrolled / Initial value

<div data-testid="select-uncontrolled-test">
  <Showcase name="uncontrolled" />
</div>

The above example passes one of the option values "Jessie" as the initial value. As a result, the matching value is selected and focused.

> The `value` prop in Qwik is similar to a `defaultValue` prop in other frameworks. For controlled values, we use signals and the bind syntax.

### Controlled / Reactive value

We can pass reactive state by using the `bind:value` prop to the `<Select />` root component.

<div data-testid="select-controlled-test">
  <Showcase name="controlled" />
</div>

`bind:value` is a signal prop, it allows us to programmatically control the selected value of the select component.

> Signal props enables two-way data binding efficiently without the common issues of change detection in other frameworks.

### Programmatic changes

To combine some of our previous knowledge, let's use the `onChange$` handler and `bind:value` prop in tandem.

<div data-testid="select-controlled-value-test">
  <Showcase name="controlled-value" />
</div>

In the above example, we can programmatically change the selected value by clicking on the "Change to Abby" button.

This allows us to update the signal value and trigger the `onChange$` handler.

### Disabled options

<div data-testid="select-disabled-test">
  <Showcase name="disabled" />
</div>

Options can be disabled by adding the `disabled` prop to the `<SelectOption />` component.

Disabled options are not selectable or focusable. They are also skipped when using the arrow keys to navigate through the options.

### Dynamically adding users

A common use case is the addition of options dynamically. For example, an infinite scrolling list of users.

<div data-testid="select-add-users-test">
  <Showcase name="add-users" />
</div>

Clicking the `Add Users` button adds a couple new users mapped to the list. Taking this further, we could grab more data from the server and add it to the list, or even hitting a database to get more users.

## Menu behavior

### Typeahead

The select offers a typeahead feature that allows users to quickly find options by typing.

<div data-testid="select-typeahead-test">
  <Showcase name="typeahead" />
</div>

It reduces the need to scroll through the available options. Typeahead is particularly handy for expected data sets, such as a list of countries.

> The ability to select options without the listbox open is also useful for those using screen readers.

### Handling listbox open / close

We may want to handle the open / close of the listbox. For example, we may want to show a loading indicator when the listbox is open.

<div data-testid="select-open-change-test">
  <Showcase name="open-change" />
</div>

To do that, we can use the `onOpenChange$` prop. A parameter is passed to the handler, which is a boolean indicating whether the listbox is open or closed.

### Looping

To loop through the options, we can use the `loop` boolean prop on the `<Select />` root component.

<div data-testid="select-loop-test">
  <Showcase name="loop" />
</div>

- Pressing the down arrow key will move focus to the first option in the list.

- Pressing the up arrow key will move focus to the last option in the list.

### Grouped options

<div data-testid="select-group-test">
  <Showcase name="group" />
</div>

The `<SelectGroup />` and `<SelectLabel />` components are used to group and label options.

Wrap the options in a group, add a Label, and you're good to go!

### Scrolling

Because focus remains on the select trigger when the listbox is open, it's important to handle scrolling in the listbox.

<div data-testid="select-scroll-test">
  <Showcase name="scrollable" />
</div>

The native `scrollIntoView` method is used to scroll the options into view when the user highlights an option.

To customize the scroll behavior, add the `scrollOptions` prop to the `<Select />` root component.

> Qwik UI does not provide virtual scrolling. However, we have found a [Qwik community member's package](https://github.com/literalpie/qwik-virtual-scroll) that has an implementation of virtual scrolling for Qwik based on [Tanstack Virtual](https://github.com/TanStack/virtual).

## Placeholder

We can provide a custom placeholder to the `<SelectValue />` component by adding the `placeholder` prop.

<div data-testid="select-wrong-value-test">
  <Showcase name="wrong-value" />
</div>

When a value is not selected, the placeholder is displayed. The example above shows a placeholder fallback when the value is not selected.

The consumer misspelled the the value, and so the fallback is displayed.

> Side note: would appreciate some help on TypeScript to make misspelled option values a thing of the past. Ideally, a union of the user's passed in options.

## Example CSS

Every code example uses the following CSS:

Some CSS variables are specific to the docs, feel free to plug in your own values or variables!

## API

### Data Attributes

`Select`, `SelectTrigger`, `SelectValue`, `SelectPopover`, and `SelectListbox` all have data attributes that are used to track state.

<AnatomyTable
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'data-open',
      description: 'If the listbox is open (Boolean).',
    },
    {
      name: 'data-closed',
      description: 'If the listbox is closed (Boolean).',
    },
  ]}
/>

`SelectOption` has the following data attributes:

<AnatomyTable
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'data-selected',
      description: 'If the option is selected. (Boolean)',
    },
    {
      name: 'data-highlighted',
      description: 'If the option is highlighted. (Boolean)',
    },
    {
      name: 'data-disabled',
      description: 'If option is disabled. (Boolean)',
    },
  ]}
/>

    },
    {
      name: 'loop',
      type: 'boolean',
      description:
        'Determines if focus cycles from the last option back to the first, or vice versa.',
    },
  ]}
